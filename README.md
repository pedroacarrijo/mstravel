<h1 align:"center"> MS Travel's Poject </h1>
ðŸš§ Project is <strong>not</strong> complete ðŸš§
<p>
  This project is a professional landing page created for my mother-in-law, who is the manager and owner of this online travel company, that offers its services at all brazilian terrotory.

  P.S: Notice that it was created by someone who is currently starting computer science graduation, of course it's not the most clean code but it's the best i can do for now! Updates related to coding optimization are going to happen soon.
  This project might be fully developed by the end of my college.
